=== When the client is disconnected from the server ===
  * The ribbon is changed to a red-orange colour. 
  * Text is added to the ribbon, right aligned saying that the server is currently unreachable. 
  * All objects (buttons) added to a list which then has all of the controls disabled so they can not send to the server. 
  * Cached data can still be read/browsed through.
